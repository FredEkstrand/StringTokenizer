String tokenizer tests

1. Test Count call for correct calculated number of tokens.
	a. With default delimiters.
	
2. basic test with defined delimiters.
	a. With defined delimiters check for correct calculated number of tokens.
	b. With this test also check Count return value.
	
3. NextToken call tests
	a. When end of string is reached pass a null.
	b. Give new delimiters and check if parsing correctly with given test string.
	
4. TokensToList call tests
	a. Check that all the tokens are returned
	b. Check that internal position is reseted back to original position before call.
	
5. HasMoreTokens
	a. Check if its returns all calculated number of tokens.

6. Reset call tests.
	a. Reset before starting tokenizing should have no affect.
	b. Reset at some random chosen point should start back at the beginning.
	c. Reset at the end of tokenization should set back to the beginning. <- able to run twice.

7. Enumeration tests
	a. Foreach loop test returns all tokens calculated.

8. Delimiters call should return a string of delimiters as defined.

9. IsReturnDelimiters should return proper t/f value 

10. Change token source. This should reset the tokenizer internal settings to start from the beginning.
	a. Change string to be tokenized after initialization with a given string.
	b. Change string to be tokenized after random point in tokenization of original string. This should start returning tokens from the new string.
	c. Change string to be tokenized after completion of originally given string has been tokenized.
	d. Return string is given string during initialization.
	e. Return string is same as given string to be tokenized in a,b,c scenarios.

11. StringTokenizer constructor test.
	a. With no given string with default delimiters.
	b. With given string and default delimiters.
	c. With no given string but with defined delimiters. <- ??
	d. With given starting string and defined delimiters.
	e. With given starting string and default delimiters with return delimiters.
	f. With no given string and default delimiters with return delimiters.
